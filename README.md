# gifcombiner
Combines imgur gifs and re-uploads them

- This app requires ImageMagick to be installed on the host system, as well as a text file containing an imgur client API id and key.
- This app has only been run on Ubuntu 14.04, but shouldn't have any specific needs across other Linux systems, as long as they have ImageMagick.

This app is probably the most DoS-vulnerable thing ever.  Please don't run this with a script, or at least contact me first.
