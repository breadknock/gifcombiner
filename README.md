# gifcombiner
Combines imgur gifs and re-uploads them

- This app requires ImageMagick to be installed on the host system, as well as a text file containing an imgur client API id and key.
- This app has only been run on Ubuntu 14.04, but shouldn't have any specific needs across other Linux systems, as long as they have ImageMagick.
